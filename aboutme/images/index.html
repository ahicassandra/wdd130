    <h2>Ahi Okati</h2>
    <p>Hey ya'll. I would like to introduce myself. I'm Polynesian raised in Dallas TX, and I have two younger siblings. The weather is bipolar over in Dallas, but it is a wonderful place to live if you're in the right areas.</p>
    <p>Both of my parents have different beliefs, so I was raised exploring both churches. I am happy to say that I've been baptised in the church of jesus christ of latter day saints in 2022.</p>
    <p>I am currently in my second semester of college, studying cybersecurity. I enjoy reading books, watching movies and spending time with friends and family.</p>
